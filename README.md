# ImgClio

Image Command Discord bot. Store images & gifs dynamically as 'commands' and retrieve them by the same name. Utilizing Sapphire.js/Discord.js, Prisma, AWS S3, and CloudFront.

## Features

- **Accessible**: Upload images and GIFs through Discord commands
  - Slash command, message command support
  - Direct upload & direct link support
